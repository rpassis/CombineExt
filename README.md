Operator details
===========

#### unwrap

Unwrap optionals and filter out nil values.

```swift
  Publishers.of(1,2,nil,Int?(4))
    .unwrap()
    .subscribe { print($0) }
```

```
next(1)
next(2)
next(4)
```

#### materialize

Turns type <T, E: Error> events into MaterilEvent<T E: Error>.
The returned Publisher never errors, and does complete after observing all of the events of the underlying Publisher.


```swift
  URLSession.shared
    .dataTaskPublisher(for: url)
    .map { $0.data }
    .decode(type: [MyModel].self, decoder: JSONDecoder())
    .materialize()
```
